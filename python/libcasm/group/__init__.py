    Notes
    -----

    This method:

    1. Finds all cyclic subgroups and stores the elements which generate unique
       cyclic subgroups as the candidate generators.
    2. Performs a depth-first search over combinations of the candidate
       generators to find all subgroups.

    This is a multithreaded method. The combinations of candidate generators is
    searched like a tree. The tree can be split into subtrees so that the search can
    be performed in parallel across multiple threads.

    There are some synchronization costs that come from reading and writing a common
    set of unique subgroups and splitting the search tree. The number of subtrees can
    be controlled with the `n_subtrees` parameter to balance  the parallelization and
    synchronization costs. The number of threads used may be controlled through
    :func:`libcasm.casmglobal.set_max_threads`. Generally it is preferable to have more
    subtrees than threads to avoid waiting on subtrees that take longer to search.

    The "alive" progress bar gives an estimated time remaining based on the time taken
    to search previous subtrees, so it may be useful to have enough subtrees to get a
    rough estimate of the time remaining. However, the estimate is usually longer than
    the actual time remaining, because the initial subtrees are likely to be among the
    longest to search.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n_subtrees: int = 100
        The number of subtrees to divide the search tree into.
    progress: Optional[str, Callable] = "alive"
        Indicates the type of progress reporting to use. The options are:

        - "alive" (default): a live progress bar is shown.
        - "plain": use the default C++ stdout progress reporting.
        - "none": no progress is reported.

        If a callable is provided, it is used as a callback function to report
        progress. A callback function must take two int arguments: the number of
        finished subtrees and the total number of subgroups found so far.
        This is called each time a subtree is finished.
