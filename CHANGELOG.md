## [2.0a8] - 2025-02-10

### Fixed

- Removed testing comment from `libcasm.local_configuration.OccEventPrimSymInfo` constructor.
- Fixed `required_cluster_size` comparison in `libcasm.occ_events.make_canonical_prim_periodic_occevents`.


## [2.0a7] - 2024-12-12

### Fixed

- Fixed tests in `test_config_space_analysis.py` which were overly strict and failed unnecessarily.


## [2.0a6] - 2024-12-10

### Added

- Added `libcasm.clusterography.make_custom_cluster_specs`, which takes a custom site filter function to generate a ClusterSpecs with custom_generators generated with the custom site filter. This approach allows creating a ClusterSpecs that is customized, as with a custom site filter, but still works to save/load without to_dict/from_dict needing the custom filter. 
- Added `make_canonical_local_configuration`, `make_distinct_local_cluster_sites`, and `make_distinct_local_perturbations` to `libcasm.enumerate`.
- Added `local_symgroup_rep` to `libcasm.configuration.Supercell`.
- Added `distances` and `phenomenal_distances` to `libcasm.clusterography.Cluster`
- Added `libcasm.local_configuration` for local configuration enumeration and comparison.
- Added `libcasm.enumerate.ConfigEnumLocalOccupations` for local configuration enumeration.
- Added `make_supercells_for_point_defects`, `find_optimal_point_defect_supercells`, `make_required_sites`, `plot_point_defect_supercell_scores`, and `print_point_defect_supercell_info` to `libcasm.enumerate` to help find optimal supercells for calculations.


### Changed

- Changed `libcasm.clusterography.make_cluster_group` documentation to state how the head group of the cluster group is set.
- Changed `libcasm.occ_events.make_occevent_group` to set the head group of the occ_event group to the head group of the group used to generate the occ_event group. In typical use this means the head group of the occ_event group is the prim factor group rather than a subgroup, even if a subgroup was used to generate the occ_event group.
- Changed the sorting order of `libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent` to sort by (cluster size, site distances, reverse molecule count), instead of by (cluster size, molecule count, site distances).

### Fixed

- Fixed `libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent.copy_reverse`, which was doing `copy_sort` instead.


## [2.0a5] - 2024-08-13

### Fixed

- Fixed `libcasm.clusterography.equivalents_info_from_dict`, which was trying to read clusters from the wrong position. This method was not used to read equivalents_info.json for KMC simulations.
- Fixed `libcasm.occ_events.get_occevent_coordinate`, which was using the reverse of the appropriate translation to get the unitcell_index.
- Fixed `to_json(to_json(config::Configuration)` and `read_dof_values` to properly support writing and reading DoF values in both the prim and standard basis.

### Changed

- Changed the `by_supercell` and `by_supercell_list` methods of `libcasm.enumerate.ConfigEnumAllOccupations` to only do default continuous DoF. 
- Changed the `skip_non_canonical` parameter of the `by_linear_site_indices`, `by_integral_site_coordinate`, `by_sublattice`, `by_cluster`, and `by_cluster_list` methods of `libcasm.enumerate.ConfigEnumAllOccupations` to `skip_equivalents`.
- Changed `ConfigEnumAllOccupations` methods that take a `background` configuration to maintain the orientation of continuous DoF.
- Changed `ClusterSpecs.from_dict` to allow reading CASM v1 cluster specs JSON by checking for a "params" attribute and parsing that if it exists.
- Changed `ClusterSpecs.from_dict` to warn if the prim has local DoF but no `"orbit_branch_specs"` attribute is present.
- Changed occ_events `to_json` methods for `occ_events::OccPosition`, `occ_events::OccTrajectory`, and `occ_events::OccEvent` to optionally accept occ_events::OccSystem.

### Added

- Added option to include phenomenal site to local-cluster site distances by passing the phenomenal cluster to `libcasm.clusterography.Cluster.to_dict`.
- Added `libcasm.configuration.Supercell.symgroup_rep`.
- Added copy methods for `libcasm.configuration.SupercellSymOp`.
- Added `Configuration.copy`, `ConfigurationWithProperties.copy`, `SupercellRecord.copy`, `ConfigurationRecord.copy`, `Cluster.copy`, and `OccEvent.copy` methods.
- Added `libcasm.configuration.copy_local_dof_values` and `libcasm.configuration.copy_global_dof_values`
- Added `which_dofs` parameter to `libcasm.configuration.make_invariant_subgroup`
- Added `libcasm.enumerate.SuperConfigEnum`
- Added `libcasm.ConfigEnumAllOccupations.by_supercell_with_continuous_dof`
- Added `__repr__` for `Cluster`, `ClusterOrbitGenerator`, and `ClusterSpecs`.
- Added `to_json` methods for `config::ConfigSpaceAnalysisResults` and `config::DoFSpaceAnalysisResults`.
- Added `Prim.__repr__`, `Supercell.__repr__`, `SupercellRecord.__repr__`, `Configuration.__repr__`, `ConfigurationRecord.__repr__`, `ConfigurationWithProperties.__repr__`, `DoFSpaceAnalysisResults.__repr__`.
- Added `ConfigSpaceAnalysisResults.to_dict` and `DoFSpaceAnalysisResults.to_dict` methods.
- Added `OccSystem.__repr__`, `OccPosition.copy`, `OccPosition.__copy__`, `OccPosition.__deepcopy__`, `OccPosition.__repr__`, `OccEventRep.__repr__`, `OccEventRep.copy`, `OccEventRep.__copy__`, `OccEventRep.__deepcopy__`, `OccEvent.__repr__`.


## [2.0a4] - 2024-07-16

### Added

### Changed

- Changed libcasm.clusterography.make_cluster_group, CASM::clust::make_cluster_group, and CASM::clust::make_cluster_groups so that the head group of the cluster group is set to the head group of the group used to generate the cluster group. In typical use this means the head group of the cluster group is the prim factor group rather than a subgroup, even if a subgroup was used to generate the cluster group.
- Fixed spelling of reservoir (#16) 
- Wheels compiled with numpy>=2.0.0

### Fixed

- Fixed occ_symgroup_rep and atom_position_symgroup_rep in CASM::config::PrimSymInfo and libcasm.configuration.Prim, which were giving the inverse of the documented permutation.

- Fixed CASM::config::make_distinct_cluster_sites
- Fixed CASM::config::dof_space_analysis for global DoF with non-primitive unit cell configuration

- Added `excluded_species` option to `Configuration.to_structure` and `ConfigurationWithProperties.to_structure`
- Added `with_prim_basis` option to `Configuration.to_dict` and `ConfigurationSet.to_dict` to allow output of DoF values in the prim basis, along with "basis" tag which is respected on reading from JSON/dict.
- Added set_order_parameters, make_dof_space, order_parameters, order_parameters_contribution, dof_values_vector, and dof_values_vector_contribution methods to libcasm.configuration.Configuration
- Added CASM::config::cluster_from_index_vector and CASM::config::cluster_from_index_set
- Added `libcasm.irreps.IrrepDecomposition` and `libcasm.irreps.MatrixRepGroup` for generic irreducible space decompositions
